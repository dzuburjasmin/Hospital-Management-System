                <h1>Hospital Management System</h1>
                <p>The main goal of the HMS is to make the process of treating and hospitalizing patients faster,
                     easier and more efficient. The aim of the system is to treat medical databases and provide a 
                     clear view of patients records and documentation. This software will make the whole process 
                     cheaper and easier, for both patients and doctors. The idea of an application like this has 
                     been born due to many flaws and problems in the traditional medical system which leads to great 
                     number of unsatisfied patients (and doctors).<br>
                     Some of the main problems people encounter in the
                      medical system are lack of doctors in an ambulance or hospital, inefficient way of treating and 
                      hospitalizing patients, slow medics prescription process, slow recipes renewal process, too much
                       unnecessary paperwork, waiting in queues for too long â€¦.<br> 
                       The business goal is to make a system
                        that will be implemented and used in all hospitals, ambulances and pharmacies. The hospital management 
                        system is a unique stand-alone system that will replace all traditional systems and their features,
                         making a universal platform that deals with all medical problems.  </p>
