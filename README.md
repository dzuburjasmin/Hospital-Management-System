# Hospital-Management-System
The aim of the application is to treat medical databases and provide a clear view of patients records and documentation. 
The idea of an application like this has been born due to many flaws and problems in the traditional medical system which leads to great number of unsatisfied patients (and doctors). Some of the main problems people encounter in the medical system are lack of doctors in an ambulance or hospital, inefficient way of treating and hospitalizing patients, slow medics prescription process, slow recipes renewal process, too much unnecessary paperwork, waiting in queues for too long etc.
A software like hospital management system would make the process of treating and hospitalizing patients faster, easier and more efficient. The aim of the system is to treat medical databases and provide a clear view of patients records and documentation. This software will make the whole process cheaper and easier, for both patients and doctors.
